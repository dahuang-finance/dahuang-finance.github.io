		<i><b>Revise and Resubmit, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis </b></i> <br>
		<button class="accordion" style="margin-bottom:0;">Abstract</button></p>
		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper shows that the rise of passive investing makes the active mutual fund industry more skilled. Greater passive investing makes it easier for active funds to outperform the benchmark and accelerates the exit of underperforming funds. In response, skilled managers take less risk to outperform more consistently. Since unskilled active managers introduce noise into stock prices, accelerating their exit improves market efficiency. These findings reconcile the rise of passive investing, closet indexing, and fund homogenization, which may imply a lack of skill, with the literature documenting the presence of skills in the active mutual fund industry. </div>

		<button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper shows that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) "sample" their indexes, systematically underweighting or omitting illiquid index stocks. As a result, arbitrage activity between the ETF and its index has heterogeneous effects on underlying asset markets. Using an instrumental variables approach, we find that the trading activity of ETFs reduces liquidity and price efficiency and increases volatility and co-movement for liquid stocks, but has no effect on illiquid stocks. Our results demonstrate that the effects of passive investing on asset markets depend on how passive funds replicate their target index. </div>

		with <a href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/sebastienbradley">Sebastien Bradley</a> and <a href="https://www.nathanseegert.com/">Nathan Seegert</a> <br> 
		<button class="accordion"> Abstract	</button> 
		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Property tax limitations reduce the pro-cyclicality of property taxes, creating a distinct form of risk that we define as covariance risk. We find that a one standard deviation increase in covariance risk raises mortgage distress by 30%, with stronger effects for residents of majority-black neighborhoods, owners of over-assessed properties, high loan-to-value borrowers, and long-tenured homeowners. We identify these effects using parcel-level data, a state border discontinuity design, and a property tax simulator we develop that incorporates assessment, rate, and levy limitations. These findings underscore how tax policy affects risk and supports policies, such as targeted tax deferral programs, that could mitigate these risks.  </div>

	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Are cryptocurrencies mere speculative bubbles, or do their prices reflect the underlying technology? We address this question by examining flaws in the underlying technology that could lead to cryptocurrency theft and their effect on returns. Most cryptocurrencies are open-source projects hosted on GitHub with public source code, whose cybersecurity flaws are documented to be fixed later. We find that one flaw predicts a 5 basis points decrease in the coin's daily return. A portfolio that longs no-flaw coins and shorts high-flaw ones, which we term the “cybersecurity factor,” earns 30 basis points daily. Our results demonstrate that cryptocurrency prices reflect the quality of its underlying technology. </div></p>

	<p style="margin:0;"><p > <b>Illiquidity-Driven Option Return Predictability</b><br> with <a href="https://brogaard.utah.edu/">Jonathan Brogaard</a> and <a href="https://giesbusiness.illinois.edu/profile/neil-pearson">Neil Pearson</a> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Empirical asset pricing literature views illiquid assets as a "bug" because they add noise and bias to analyses of return predictability. In this paper, we show that illiquidity is a feature rather than a bug for option return predictability. Previously well-documented trading strategies with high Sharpe ratio become unprofitable once we purge illiquid options from the analyses. Illiquidity is the source of return predictability. Our results are robust to varies microstructure bias corrections, suggesting thinly-traded and heavily-traded options are fundamentally different. Our results have important implications for future empirical research in option markets. </div></p>

	<p style="margin:0;"><p > <b>Pricing Property Tax Risk</b> <br> with <a href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/sebastienbradley">Sebastien Bradley</a> and <a href="https://www.nathanseegert.com/">Nathan Seegert</a> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We develop a method of pricing tax risk using a Arrow-Debreu model combined with a detailed tax model. To demonstrate this method, we build a tax simulation model for property taxes in the United States that captures key features that differ across states and change the risk associated with the property tax. In this context, we conceptualize property tax payments as the payouts of a complex asset that differ across states of the world. We then simply price these payouts using an Arrow-Debreu pricing model. Pricing tax risk in this way has several important applications and is easily implemented. </div></p>

	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does high-frequency trade increase or decrease volatility in financial markets during crises? We introduce a novel intraday volatility measure for ETFs, and find that during the Covid-19 crisis period, the withdrawal of high-frequency trade from large stock ETFs increases intraday ETF volatility net of the fundamental shock from Covid itself by over 30%. The speed of arbitrage activities slows down during the Covid-19 period as high-frequency traders reduce the intensity of their trading. While high frequency traders may serve as de facto market makers during normal times, they withdraw from the market during a crisis, precisely when they are needed most. </div></p>

	<p style="margin:0;"><p > <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3961574"><b>Non-Standard Errors</b></a> <br> Crowd-sourced project with <a href="https://fincap.academy/">#fincap</a>, <i><b>Journal of Finance,  </b></i> 79(3), 2339-2390   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<button class="accordion">  Abstract	</button>
	<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> In statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data-generating process (DGP). Standard errors measure the uncertainty in sample estimates of population parameters. In science, evidence is generated to test hypotheses in an evidence-generating process (EGP). We claim that EGP variation across researchers adds uncertainty: non-standard errors. To study them, we let 164 teams test six hypotheses on the same sample. We find that non-standard errors are sizeable, on par with standard errors. Their size (i) co-varies only weakly with team merits, reproducibility, or peer rating, (ii) declines significantly after peer-feedback, and (iii) is underestimated by participants. </div></p>
