		Revise and Resubmit, <b>Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis </b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<button class="accordion">Abstract</button> </p>
		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper shows that the rise of passive investing makes the active mutual fund industry more skilled. Greater passive investing makes it easier for active funds to outperform the benchmark and accelerates the exit of underperforming funds. In response, skilled managers take less risk to outperform more consistently. Since unskilled active managers introduce noise into stock prices, accelerating their exit improves market efficiency. These findings reconcile the rise of passive investing, closet indexing, and fund homogenization, which may imply a lack of skill, with the literature documenting the presence of skills in the active mutual fund industry. </div>

		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Property tax limitations reduce the pro-cyclicality of property taxes, creating a distinct form of covariance risk. Controlling for the level of taxation, we find that a one standard deviation increase in covariance risk raises the probability of mortgage distress by 30%, with stronger effects for financially vulnerable and racial minority households. We identify these effects using parcel-level data, a state border discontinuity design, and a novel property tax simulator that incorporates assessment, rate, and levy limitations, along with other key tax system characteristics. These findings underscore how tax policy affects risk and supports policies, such as targeted tax deferral programs, that could mitigate these risks.  </div>

		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Do firm managers listen more to some shareholders than others? We show that directors facing the same level of dissent are twice as likely to leave the board when the dissent originates from active fund shareholders rather than passive ones. This phenomenon is driven by the stronger disciplinary threat posed by active funds rather than by any informational advantage. As a result, despite the large holdings of the "Big Three" passive asset managers, we find that their votes carry the same weight as those of an average active fund. Our findings highlight that shareholder democracy depends not only on the vote tally, but also on who casts the votes. </div>

		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper studies the joint dynamics of cryptocurrency technology, returns, and labor markets for developers. We construct high-frequency measures of GitHub bug reports ("Technology Flaws") and code commits ("Technology Development") for major coins. The main results are twofold. First, a new Technology Flaw predicts a 7 bp drop in next-day returns without future reversals. Second, a 1% decrease in coin valuation leads to a 0.14% decrease in Technology Development labor. These findings suggest that technology is a fundamental factor in cryptocurrency prices, and that prices and technology development coevolve through a bidirectional feedback mechanism. </div>

		with <a href="https://www.vasudhanair.com">Vasudha Nair</a> and <a href="https://merage.uci.edu/research-faculty/faculty-directory/Christopher-Schwarz.html">Chris Schwarz</a>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<button class="accordion">Abstract</button> </p>
		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Active exchange-traded funds (AETFs) have grown rapidly despite the decline of poor-performing active mutual funds (AMFs). AETFs' growth, however, is not due to superior performance. In fact, AETFs have significantly worse performance than AMFs. Rather, AETFs are taking advantage of the attention-driven trading behavior of retail investors. Similar to equity investors, AETF investors chase extreme short-term returns, both positive and negative, while long-term flows have no response to underperformance. Managers respond to these payoffs by taking high risks to generate extreme returns. 
Overall, our results show how active management has responded to the decline of their traditional distribution channel.   </div>

		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper shows that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) "sample" their indexes, systematically underweighting or omitting illiquid index stocks. As a result, arbitrage activity between the ETF and its index has heterogeneous effects on underlying asset markets. Using an instrumental variables approach, we find that the trading activity of ETFs reduces liquidity and price efficiency and increases volatility and co-movement for liquid stocks, but has no effect on illiquid stocks. Our results demonstrate that the effects of passive investing on asset markets depend on how passive funds replicate their target index. </div>

		with <a href="https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/people/rajesh-k-aggarwal/">Rajesh Aggarwal</a> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does high-frequency trade increase or decrease volatility in financial markets during crises? We introduce a novel intraday volatility measure for ETFs, and find that during the Covid-19 crisis period, the withdrawal of high-frequency trade from large stock ETFs increases intraday ETF volatility net of the fundamental shock from Covid itself by over 30%. The speed of arbitrage activities slows down during the Covid-19 period as high-frequency traders reduce the intensity of their trading. While high frequency traders may serve as de facto market makers during normal times, they withdraw from the market during a crisis, precisely when they are needed most. </div></p>

	<p style="margin:0;"><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3961574"><b>Non-Standard Errors</b></a> <br> 
		Crowd-sourced project with <a href="https://fincap.academy/">#fincap</a>, <i><b>Journal of Finance,  </b></i> 79(3), 2339-2390   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<button class="accordion">Abstract</button>
		<div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> In statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data-generating process (DGP). Standard errors measure the uncertainty in sample estimates of population parameters. In science, evidence is generated to test hypotheses in an evidence-generating process (EGP). We claim that EGP variation across researchers adds uncertainty: non-standard errors. To study them, we let 164 teams test six hypotheses on the same sample. We find that non-standard errors are sizeable, on par with standard errors. Their size (i) co-varies only weakly with team merits, reproducibility, or peer rating, (ii) declines significantly after peer-feedback, and (iii) is underestimated by participants. </div></p>
